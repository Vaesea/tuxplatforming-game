These are credits that are even more detailed than the one on the GitHub README. This is in the assets folder so it's included when the game compiles.

The base code is from Discover HaxeFlixel, but it has been modified a lot by Vaesea (for Tux Platforming and PepperTux) and AnatolyStev (for PepperTux)
The code is licensed under GPL 3.

Most assets, at least the ones made for the game, are licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0. You can check which assets are made for the game here.
In cases where the license is not CC-BY-SA 4.0, the license will be put in the same line with the rest of the stuff about the file.

All 2D player Tux images are made by Vaesea, they can't have any license as Tux doesn't seem to be under any license. You can use the images freely.
Worldmap Tux is the image that Larry Ewing created for Linux, which doesn't seem to be under any license, so it seems you can use that image freely.

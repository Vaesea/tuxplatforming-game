# Tux Platforming
Tux Platforming. Not to be confused with SuperTux, which is another really good Tux game!

## Story
Tux was walking around an island one day, when he decided to challenge himself to get through a desert, but what he didn't know, is that this would start a journey where he goes to different parts of the island to defeat different things...

## What is this inspired by?
This is inspired by Super Mario Bros, but it may be inspired by SuperTux Milestone 1 too, especially with the art as that's really the only style I know how to do decently.

## What needs to be done?
There's a lot to be done, but for the first version (v0.1.0), there needs to be 16 fun levels and decent art for desert levels. Help is appreciated.

## Credits
- Haxe, HaxeFlixel, Lime, and others - HaxeFlixel is used for this game, and HaxeFlixel uses things like Lime, Haxe, Flixel and OpenFL (I think?)
- Discover HaxeFlixel - A lot of the code is gonna be from Discover HaxeFlixel. I feel like at the end of the project, the code might not look that similar, but this will be used as a base.
